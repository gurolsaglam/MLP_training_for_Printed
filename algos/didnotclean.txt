I (Gurol) did not edit decision_tree, logistic_regression, random_forest, svm.

For these classes, I also removed 
"dump(bmodel,"trained_models/" + self.name.split(".")[0] + "/" + self.name + "_" + str(self.hidden_layer_sizes) + "_acc" + str(accuracy) + "_clf.joblib")"
from searchAndEvalClassifier function in Algo class. This should be added in those classes or introduced in some way.
